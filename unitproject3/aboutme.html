            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p><b>Hi.</b> My name is Kassie.
            <br>Nice to meet you. Thanks for coming to my website! I am an aspiring web developer working on my skills. What are they, you might ask.</p>
            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>AWS</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>Linux</li>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>Adobe Creative Suite</li>
                <li>Microsoft Office</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Don't worry, those aren't the only skills I have. I'm also <em>dependable, creative, a hard worker, and humble</em> too!</p>
            <h3>Where am I in my Educational Journey?</h3>
            <p>Well, that's a great question. I am currently a Junior at Utah State University in good ol' Logan, Utah. Because of this, I have already taken a wide variety of courses regarding database management, Python, cloud computing, and more! Don't worry, I've also taken a whole suite of healthcare-related classes as well <code>&#8212</code> if you think you're having a heart attack, I can pop on over and take an EKG on you.</p>
            <h3>Where have you worked? How are you so amazing?</h3>
            <p>Stop, I'm blushing. I've worked plenty of places in plenty of roles.</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Space Dynamics Laboratory</dt>
                    <dd>I worked in Corporate Events for about 5 months, coordinating with high-profile companies to churn out over ten events in my short time there. Currently, I work on the web development team, updating internal applications.</dd>
                    <dt>Logan Regional Hospital</dt>
                    <dd>Here is where I refined my EKG taking skills, and I am certified to read EKGs. I also administered stress tests, and compiled information for doctors and exercise physiologists. I've been known to read a holter monitor or two as well.</dd>
                    <dt>Utah State University</dt>
                    <dd>What could be more fun than COVID testing for your own university? Especially when it requires you to dress up in a sweet yellow gown and face shield every day!</dd>
                    <dt>Island Oral and Facial Surgery</dt>
                    <dd>Let's get real. This job was crazzzzzy. I assisted the surgeon, charted drugs used, sterilized instruments, consulted patients, and was even known to plan a party or two for the local dentists. Jack of all trades, am I right?</dd>
                    <dt>Spriggs Yacht Services</dt>
                    <dd>I may have spent a summer detailing yachts at the docks near my house. My attention to detail is now <em>unmatched</em>, and I drool a little bit when I see teak now.</dd>
                </dl>
            <h3>Where do I want to go from here?</h3>
            <p>I certainly still have a bit of time left until I graduate. I am highly interested in designing websites, but also would love to be involved with any sort of outdoor-related companies. I am also passionate about healthcare, and the idea of contributing to the medical software used by professionals is *chefs kiss* to me.</p>
            <div id="beforefinalnote">
                <p>Thanks <b>so much</b> for learning a bit more about me. I'm excited to learn about you, too!</p>
